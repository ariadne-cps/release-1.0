These installation instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and OSX 10.11.

For the Ubuntu installation, we will refer to packages available on Aptitude. The OSX installation instead will assume you are using the Brew package manager.

The build system is CMake. The compiler we tested the library under Ubuntu is g++, while for OSX is clang. To build the library in a clean way, it is preferable that you set up a build subdirectory:

> mkdir build
> cd build

The library dependencies of ARIADNE are the following:

(Ubuntu)
Aptitude packages required: git cmake libboost-system-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-thread-dev libgtk2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libbdd-dev

(OSX)
Install the Command Line Developer Tools (will also be asked when installing Homebrew) from the Apple Store
Install Homebrew from http://brew.sh/
Homebrew packages required: cmake boost gtk cairo
No Buddy package is offered, you need to compile the library from https://sourceforge.net/projects/buddy/
Download and extract the Buddy package, then from the extracted directory do:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Optionally, if you want to build the documentation, you need Doxygen and a working Latex distribution (including the Math packages).

Then you can prepare the build environment:

> cmake ..

At this point, if no error arises, you can build the library itself:

> make

Optionally, you can also run the test suite for the library:

> make test

where no error should appear.

If you want to build the documentation, you have to issue the following:

> make doc

To install the library globally, you must do
> make install

To find the installed library under Ubuntu, you may need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the .bashrc file:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
