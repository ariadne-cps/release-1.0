These installation instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 12.04+ and OSX 10.10+.

For the Ubuntu installation, we will refer to packages available on Aptitude. The OSX installation instead will assume you are using the Brew package manager.

The library dependencies of ARIADNE are the following:

(Ubuntu)
Boost: libboost-system-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-thread-dev
GTK: libgtk2.0-dev
Cairo: libcairo2-dev
Buddy: libbdd-dev

(OSX)
Boost: boost
GTK: gtk
Cairo: cairo
Buddy: no package is offered, you need to compile the library from https://sourceforge.net/projects/buddy/

Optionally, if you want to build the documentation, you need Doxygen and a working Latex distribution (including the Math packages).

The build system is CMake. The compiler we tested the library under Ubuntu is g++, while for OSX is clang. To build the library in a clean way, it is preferable that you set up a build subdirectory:

> mkdir build
> cd build

Then you can prepare the build environment:

> cmake ..

At this point, if no error arises, you can build the library itself:

> make

Optionally, you can also run the test suite for the library:

> make test

where no error should appear.

If you want to build the documentation, you have to issue the following:

> make doc

To install the library globally, you must copy the dynamic library file created (either libariadne.so or libariadne.dylib) into your /usr/local/lib directory, and the content of the include/ directory into a /usr/local/include/ariadne directory. Then you can 
#include <ariadne/ariadne.h>
